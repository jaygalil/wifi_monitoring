4. **Ask Follow-ups**: Build on previous responses for deeper insights

### Sample Conversation Flow:
```
You: "Analyze my site connectivity data"
AI: [Provides analysis of your data]

You: "Which province needs the most attention?"
AI: [Focuses on specific geographic area]

You: "Suggest 3 optimal locations for new sites in that province"
AI: [Provides specific recommendations with coordinates]
```
